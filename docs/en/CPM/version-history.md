# Version History

**Version 18.5 A19.3 b6 Stable (29-12-2020)**

* Bundled CPM WebUI 1.7.3: fixed permission handler to break menu icon because of casesensitivity of permissions. Permissions in cpmcc_permissions.xml now get applied regardless of case. This will ensure the menu icon to show.

Implemented 2 small user requests:
* With CPM 18.4.3 release (adding item used on player, zombie and animal kill) the PVE violation logline was changed and a "Player killed" logline was added to show item used on kill. This broke existing CSMM custom hooks relying on the old PVE violation logline. This version contains the "old" logline with item used appended at absolute end. This will ensure existing PVE violation hooks to be compatible.

Player killed logline (use to extract PVP kill info):

```[CSMM_Patrons] Player killed! Player offenderName (-128,60,-189) killed victimName (-130,60,-190) with Pistol```

PVE violation logline (use to extract PVE violation kill info):

```[CSMM_Patrons] PVE violation! Player offenderName (-128,60,-189) killed victimName (-130,60,-190) with Pistol```

* Added signs to be unlocked with unlockall consolecommand.

**Version 18.4.4 A19.2 b4 Stable & A19.3 b6 Experimental (20-12-2020)**

* Added anticheat leveljump: CPM will issue a warning into log for use with discord notification or csmm hook (for custom punishment) on jumping more than one level at once. Example logline: [CSMM_Patrons] WARNING: Prisma501 (73653876287651987) jumped up more than one level (10 -> 75).

**Version 18.4.3 A19.2 b4 Stable & A19.3 b6 Experimental (19-12-2020)**

* Added item (weapon) used to logline on zombie, animal and PVP kill. Can be used for CSMM hooks.

**Version 18.4.2 A19.3 Experimental Only (16-12-2020)**

* Changed consolecommand shutdownba: the server shutdown logic has changed in 19.3. Adapted shutdownba to handle the shutdown properly. This version is for A19.3 only.

**Version 18.4.1 A19.2 b4 Stable & A19.3 b5 Experimental (24-11-2020)**

* Added option for using minimum uptime of server to be taken into account on shutdownba consolecommand. Define in CpmSettings.xml in minutes (ShutdownBA_MinimumUptimeRequired). Server crashed or did a manual reboot just before a scheduled reboot? Dont want to have players face a new reboot in a short amount of time? Then this setting is for you. Default value is 0, so shutdownba will not considder server uptime. If the minimum uptime of the server has not been reached while doing shutdownba, the reboot will wait until the minimum server uptime has been reached and then finish the shutdownba command.

**Version 18.4 A19.2 b4 Stable & A19.3 b5 Experimental (21-11-2020)**

* Added tooltip communication (instead of chatmessages) for enterresetregion, exitresetregion, enterpveclaim, exitpveclaim, reversed claim, normal claim, lcbfree claim, landclaim claim, lcbinregion (resetregion), lcb2close (resetregion), allpoiprotectionlcb, allpoiprotectionbed, questpoiprotectionlcb, questpoiprotectionbed and onvehicle warnig for all relevant claims.
* optional visual indicator on players gamescreen during the time present on an adv. claim.
* Backwards compatible with existing claims.
* Choice for owners to use tooltips or the "old" chatsystem.
* no changes in claim creation process
* maximum flexibility by using tooltip modlet (see help text in the xml in /config in CPM mod folder)
* added consolecommand tooltip: show a custom tooltip to a (or all) player(s) on demand.

**Version 18.3 A19.2 b4 Stable & A19.3 b3 Experimental (16-11-2020)**

* Catalysm updated CPM Web UI to 1.7.1: added support for the getvehicles api. Now all vehicles can be viewed on CPM Web UI. New version is included in this release.

**Version 18.2 A19.2 b4 Stable & A19.3 b3 Experimental (16-11-2020)**

* added webapi for displaying all vehicles on the map. Both loaded and unloaded vehicles will be shown. When vehicle name starts with "Entity", the vehicle is not currently loaded in the world. When vehicle name starts with "vehicle", the vehicle is currently loaded in the world. For permission control add "permission module="cpmcc.getvehicles" permission_level="0"" to cpmcc_permissions.xml. By default the permission level is 0.
* added vehicles to allocs patched [map.js](https://github.com/Prisma501/Allocs-Webmap-for-CPM) to make use of the new webapi

**Version 18.1 A19.2 b4 Stable (not A18.4 Stable Compatible) (23-10-2020)**

* Catalysm updated CPM Web UI to 1.7: new Adv. Claims Landclaim and ProBlock are supported now. Improved readability on coordinates information. New CPM Web UI 1.7 is included in this release.

**Version 18.0 A19.2 b4 Stable (not A18.4 Stable Compatible) (23-10-2020)**

* Added Adv. Claim Landclaim: only claimowners, whitelisted players and accesslevel allowed players can place any block within this adv. claim. Type= "landclaim". Violation string configurable in CpmStrings.xml (AdvClaims_Landclaim). Auto giveback to placing player.
* Added Adv. Claim ProBlock: Use this claim to prevent placement of blocks that are not configured as problock(s). Violation string configurable in CpmStrings.xml (AdvClaims_ProBlock). Auto giveback to placing player.
Usage: create claim with type "problock:block1;block2;block3". Blocknames are casesenstive (use fblock to find exact blocknames) and must be separated by semicolon when adding more than 1 block. Follows standard claim rules regarding accesslevel, ownership and whitelisting.
* Added webapi for querying new Adv. Claims Landclaim and ProBlock
* Changed Adv. Claim PVE: skip chatmessage when exitmessage of the claim is omitted.
* Changed Adv. Claim AntiBlock: implemented auto giveback to placing player.
* Updated patched Allocs Webmap: added checkboxes and handlers for new Adv. Claims Landclaim and ProBlock

**Version 17.8 A19.1 b8 Stable (not A18.4 Stable Compatible) (30-09-2020)**

* Added character based name login blocking: prevent players with specified characters in name from logging in. Configure in CpmSettings.xml (SpecialCharacters and SpecialCharactersNameBlock_Enabled). Beware of adding xml breaking chars to CpmSettings.xml. Escape them if needed. 
```& becomes &amp; , < becomes &lt; , > becomes &gt;```
Kickmessage is configurable in CpmStrings.xml
* Added AllPoi Protection: same as QuestPoi Protection but for all prefabs. Prevents LCB and bedrolls to be placed in any POI. Configure in CpmSettings.xml (AllPoiProtection_Enabled). Not allowed messages for bed and LCB are configurable in CpmStrings.xml

**Version 17.7 A19.1 b8 Stable (not A18.4 Stable Compatible) (22-09-2020)**

* Fixed consolecommand release: Fixed offline usage. Now it's possible to release a player from jail while offline again.
* Added bedroll support to adv. claim antiblock: Now you can add bedroll as antiblock in an adv. claim antiblock.

**Version 17.6 A19 b180 Stable (not A18.4 Stable Compatible) (26-08-2020)**

* There is a serious vanilla game bug in the region file management code that was causing CPM reset commands to reset chunks that should not be reset. This version contains a harmony patch that overrides the bugged region file manager method with fixed code.
* Fixed locationtracker throwing null reference exception when game player dictionary would add/remove players to/from dictionary during location saving.

**Version 17.5 A19 b180 Stable (not A18.4 Stable Compatible) (24-08-2020)**

* Added sleeper volume resets to "getprefab reset", rac (resetadvclaim), "rac unclaimed" and rrp (resetrwgprefabs). Now all sleepervolumes in prefabs and chunks in an adv. claim reset will get reset also with a reset. This means no free lootruns (new fresh prefab without sleepers).
* Added ServerTools compatibility for when using ST Reserved slots and server is full. The harmony patch in ST will break CPM functionality when that kicks in. That is countered in this version.

**Version 17.4 A19 b180 Experimental (not A18.4 Stable Compatible) (18-08-2020)**

* Fixed consolecommand sleepers: removing sleepers broke with A19. Fixed now. Added reset functionality. Now you can despawn and reset sleepers in the marked area so that they are ready to haunt players again.
* Added serverkill on hanging/unresponsive server in rrp (resetrwgprefabs) and rac (resetadvclaim) consolecommands when using the kicklockreboot parameter. Now they will handle a hanging/unresponsive server in the reboot process like shutdownba does.
* Removed all dependencies to allocs persistent data for playerdata. CPM will store all nescesary data in own persistent storage now, so if allocs mod loses data, CPM will not be affected.
* Updated CPM Web UI to version 1.6.1: Catalysm fixed a bug where a claim would get double displayed in the Adv. Claim list when a type of claim would be in the string parameters of another claim.
* Since ServerTools has recently found its way to Harmony 2, i decided to not maintain 2 CPM versions anymore (Harmony 1.2 and 2.0). CPM will only come in the flavor of Harmony 2 from this release on. This means it will not be compatible with mods that use Harmony 1.2 anymore. Botman mod is one of the last that uses the old Harmony version 1.2 and thus will be not be compatible with CPM until they upgrade Harmony to 2.0.

**Version 17.3 A19 b180 Experimental (not A18.4 Stable Compatible) (11-08-2020)**

* Changed consolecommand rrp (resetrwgprefabs): added parameter "tradersonly" for resetting all traders on the map only. Usefull when having used settime command and the traders restock time has gone out of sync.
* Changed consolecommands rrp (resetrwgprefabs), rac (resetadvclaim): added parameter "kicklockreboot". When using this parameter all online players will get kicked, the server gets locked (players cant connect) during the reset and reboots server when reset is done. You can still use rrp and rac and rac unclaimed without kicklockreboot for full manual control but keep in mind that de world will be in a time vacuum during the reset. Any online players will experience it like X-men member Quicksilver. Literally.
* Catalysm has updated CPM WebUI to 1.6! It contains the new Adv. Claim Reset. Included in this release.

**Version 17.2 A19 b178 Experimental (not A18.4 Stable Compatible) (08-08-2020)**

* Changed consolecommand resetchunks: No need for chunks to be loaded to be reset. Makes larger areas of resetting possible. Theoratically up to 16K x 16K blocks. The larger the area the more memory you need to have available for the reset. So be wise when using.
* Changed rrp (resetrwgprefabs): Complete overhaul. All prefabs will be reset live on map in one run. No need for players to load the chunks anymore. Added restoring decorations on prefab reset.
* Changed consolecommand "getprefab reset": Added restoring decorations on prefab reset.
* Added new Adv. Claim Reset: mark an area for reset on chunklevel.
* Added new consolecommand rac (resetadvclaim): use for resetting all chunks within the new Adv. Claim Reset areas. Very memory intensive! Better use multiple smaller claims instead of few big claims. The bigger the claim the more memory is needed for CPM to be able to handle. Has an option to reset the complete map excluding claimed chunks -> Very VERY memory intensive. Tested on a 8GB virtual system with NO players on and the 8GB were almost FULLY used. Use with care. Server will crash with out of memory exception if your hardware isnt up for this.
* added webapi for displaying new Adv. Claim Reset on allocs,- or CPM webUI map.
* changed consolecommand ccc: added option to create new Adv. Claim Reset. New claim borders will automatically snap to nearest chunk borders so you know exactly what is going to reset when using consolecommand rac. Use claim type=reset for creating Adv. Claim Reset.
* changed allocs patched map.js to be able to display new Adv. Claim Reset

**Version 17.1 A19 b173 Experimental (not A18.4 Stable Compatible) (03-08-2020)**

* Updated Confuser.Core to 1.4.1
* Disabled one of the confuser protections at expence of a little protection loss for a BIG performance gain.

**Version 17.0 A19 b173 Experimental (not A18.4 Stable Compatible) (01-08-2020)**

* Major maintenance upgrade:
    - Reworked/optimized the litedb database layer for performance. Mainly ditching the use of LiteCollection which appearantly keept a reference to the db on disk open.
    - Reviewed all (5 year worth) of code and cleaned up/optimized to today's standards.
    - Reworked the harmony patch handling to be able to easily maintain a harmony 2.0 branch.

**Version 16.7 A19 b173 Experimental (not A18.4 Stable Compatible) (31-07-2020)**

* The sleeper support on hostilefree adv. claim is giving me serious headaches. Seems the sleeper hook fires so fast and much that the litedb database on filesystem gets opened so much (60 times a second) that it can't process it all and queing up the open filehandles on the server, which is bad. I moved the hostilefree claims to memory and check inmemory in the sleeper hook. This should prevent exceeding the open file limit on linux. Downside of this solution is that any hostilefree adv. claim you create on an active gamesession will not support sleeper spawn prevention until the next gameserver restart (hostilefree adv. claims get loaded into memory on gamerestart). Again this is a HIGHLY recommended update if you are on CPM version 16.3 or higher!!

**Version 16.6 A19 b173 Experimental (not A18.4 Stable Compatible) (29-07-2020)**

* HOTFIX for all sleeper related functionality. Since CPM adapting to the new sleepervolume handling of the game i noticed high CPU spikes after logging off. Somehow the sleeper spawn hook keeps firing over and over and over again when last player of the server disconnects near sleepervolumes. Resulting in high CPU usage on an empty server. Added a check for no players on server and give back control to game then. That fixes the problem. HIGHLY recommended to upgrade if on version 16.3 or higher!!

**Version 16.5 A19 b173 Experimental (not A18.4 Stable Compatible) (27-07-2020)**

* Fixed ResetRegions, QuestPoiProtection, Adv. CLaim LcbFree and Adv. Claim AntiBlock not triggering when LCB/Bedroll/AntiBlock was placed on plant (like grass) or in water. This is it boyz and galz, the new system is completely fleshed out and to my liking. There wont be an update for a good while now. 

**Version 16.4 A19 b173 Experimental (not A18.4 Stable Compatible) (27-07-2020)**

* CPM is using harmony for runtime server patching and litedb for persistent data storage. Until now i merged those helper dll's into the CPM dll, because the modloader system of the game did not allow multiple dll's/xml's in the Mod folder. That is now allowed and because it positively affects performance, i dont merged them anymore. This version uses the unmerged helper dll's but is exactly the same as version 16.3.

**Version 16.3 A19 b173 Experimental (not A18.4 Stable Compatible) (26-07-2020)**

* fixed Questpoi protection being always on regardless of setting in CpmSettings.xml.
* Reverted from killing to despawning hostiles in hostilefree adv. claim, consolecmd protect and chatcmd /bubble for server stability/performance.
* Implemented sleeper support for hostilefree adv. claim, consolecmd protect and chatcmd /bubble. No more infinite sleeper respawn loops if using any of those functionalities. Sleepers will just not spawn when in hostilefree adv. claim or within 25 blocks of a player while protection is on with protect or /bubble.
* fixed sleeper respawn control (DisableSleeperRespawn_Enabled in CpmSettings.xml) due to changes in sleepervolumes in A19 b173.
* fixed sleeper control (DisableSleepers_Enabled in CpmSettings.xml) due to changes in sleepervolumes in A19 b173.
* fixed sleeper control for bloodmoons only (DisableSleepers_BloodmoonOnly_Enabled in CpmSettings.xml) due to changes in sleepervolumes in A19 b173.
* Catalysm updated CPM WebUI and added support for new adv. claim AntiBlock! Version 1.5.0 is included in this release.
* Making something clear: The new resetregions, adv. claim LcbFree, Questpoi protection and adv. claim AntiBlock are only checking on block placement of LCB/Bedroll/AntiBlock. CPM will handle them instantly(!). CPM will however NOT remove allready existing LCB/Bedroll/AntiBlock in resetregions, adv. claim LcbFree, Questpois and adv. claim Antiblock after you set/enable them. Be aware of that when enabling any of those functionalities and check on CPM WebUI if you have some manual cleaning up to do.

**Version 16.2 A19 b173 Experimental (not A18.4 Stable Compatible) (25-07-2020)**

* A19 b173 Compatibility. 16.1 seems 100% compatible, but recompiled, repacked and re-encrypted against A19 b173 binaries. In case of problems with 16.1 upgrade first before asking for support.
* Changed command help text and description for rl (resetlevel) and rs (resetskillpoints) to make it....more clear.

**Version 16.1 A19 b169 Experimental (not A18.4 Stable Compatible) (23-07-2020)**

* Heavily optimized ResetRegion, QuestPoiProtection and LcbFree Adv. Claim handling: Moved away from heartbeat thread. Now using gamehook to instantly(!) remove/giveback LCB/Bedroll.

* Added WebApi for viewing new Adv. Claim AntiBlock.

* Updated [Allocs Patched map.js](https://github.com/Prisma501/Allocs-Webmap-for-CPM) for viewing new Adv. Claim AntiBlock

Implemented 2 requests:

* Added new adv. claim antiblock: Use this claim to prevent placement of configurable block(s). Blocks that are not allowed in this claim will be instantly(!) removed.

Usage: create claim with type "antiblock:block1;block2;block3". Blocknames are casesenstive (use fblock to find exact blocknames) and must be separated by semicolon when adding more than 1 block. Follows standard claim rules regarding accesslevel and whitelisting.

* Added writable storage to consolecommands unlockall and own.

**Version 15.9.1 A19 b169 Experimental (not A18.4 Stable Compatible) (17-07-2020)**

* A19 b169 Compatibility
* After simplifying the QuestPoi protection code drastically in 15.9, a bug became clearly visible. Lcb's/bedrolls that overlap multiple questpois would cause multiple removals/deactivations of lcb's/bedroll. Fixed with this version.

**Version 15.9 A19 b163 Experimental (not A18.4 Stable Compatible) (17-07-2020)**

* Changed consolecommand listcustomentities (lce): Pimps changed the entityType for traders. Changed searchstring npc to trader. For listing traders do "lce trader". Used to be "lce npc"
* Changed Questpoi protection: the bedroll handling ingame is an absolute chaos. Changed it again to be more robust but less functional. This version wont support existing bedrolls in questpois anymore. If you enable questpoi protection after players have allready placed bedroll in questpoi's they will only get deactivated when the owning player is online. If owning player never comes online again, the bedroll has to be removed manually. If a bedroll is deactivated it will not be seen as blocking for a questpoi on queststart immediately. It will however be the players spawnpoint until he/she places a new bedroll or the server restarts.
* Changed hostilefree adv. claim and protective bubble to do a kill instead of a despawn. Sleepers wont get into a respawn loop this way.

**Version 15.8 A19 b163 Experimental (not A18.4 Stable Compatible) (13-07-2020)**

* Implemented using a dedicated thread for handling online players on ttp edit commands resetskillpoints (rs), resetlevel (rl), resetplayerdata (rpd), removexpdeficit (red) and removevendingrent (rvr) to not hold up the main server thread while working.

**Version 15.7 A19 b163 Experimental (not A18.4 Stable Compatible) (12-07-2020)**

* Found the cause of the bedroll persistency problem in A19 and re-introduced asynchronously handling lcb/bedroll. Highly recommended to upgrade.

**Version 15.6.1 A19 b163 Experimental (not 18.4 Stable Compatible) (09-07-2020)**

* fixed an error i let slip in on 15.6 on ResetRegions. When placing a LCB in a ResetRegion and the claim borders are overlapping a neighbouring ResetRegion, the player would get back 2 LCB's instead of one.

**Version 15.6 A19 b157 Experimental (09-07-2020)**

* fixed QuestPoiProtection, ResetRegions and Adv. Claim LcbFree not being able to handle allready existing lcb's/bedrolls in unloaded chunks on use/enable in an ongoing map. You can now use/enable those on an existing map with lcb's/bedrolls allready present in QuestPoi's, ResetRegions and Adv. Claims LcbFree.

**Version 15.5 A19 b157 Experimental (07-07-2020)**

* fixed shutdownba not considdering bloodmoon off and random bloodmoon
* fixed nighttime announcer not considdering bloodmoon off
* fixed day7 chatcommand not considdering bloodmoon off
* fixed permadeath. A19e compatibility
* upped waiting time after kick to 10 seconds on ttp edit/delete commands on online players: resetlevel, resetskillpoints, removeexpdeficit, resetplayerdata and removevendingrental. Should work better when using on online players. Using on offline players is still failsafe.

Sometimes it takes a while for the player profile to be saved to ttp file by the game. When its not saved completely when CPM does the edit/delete, the Pimps backup mechanism will kick in and the edit/delete will be undone. For offline players it works 100% of the time. 10 seconds should be enough to save but not long enough for the player to have joined again thus loading and using the ttp file and causing the edit to be undone again.

**Version 15.4 A19 b157 Experimental (06-07-2020)**

* Fixed anticheat damagedetection not logging when triggered.

Example logline for creating CSMM custom discord notifcation hook:

[CSMM_Patrons]damageDetection(Entity): Player Prisma501 (7656114567822412) triggered damage detection! Damage done: 5000

**Version 15.3 A19 b157 Experimental (04-07-2020)**

* Fixed consolecommand lce (listcustomentity)

**Version 15.2 A19 b157 Experimental (02-07-2020)**

* Fixed consolecommand bexport
* Fixed questpoi protection
* Fixed consolecommand db (deactivatebed)

**Version 14.6 A18.4 b4 Stable (NOT A18.3 compatible)**

Some ttp love this release. All new commands alter data that is stored in the players ttp file. That can only be editted when player is not online. So all new commands do a player kick if player is online.

* New consolecommand rl (resetlevel): set a players level to a level of your choice
* New consolecomand rs (resetskillpoints): set the number of skillpoints of a player to the count of your choice
* New consolecommand red (removeexpdeficit): remove a players ExpDeficit on demand. ExpDeficit is the XP penalty you get after dying (red bar in the XP bar above belt)

**Version 14.5 A18.4 b4 Stable (NOT A18.3 compatible)**

* changed donorslots: added admin notification on expired donor server join. All online admins of a configurable level get a PM notification when an expired donor joins. Configure admin level in CpmSettings.xml ( NotifyAdmin_Level). Default is level 0.

Also added logline for easy CSMM custom hooking. Logline is:
[CSMM_Patrons] Donorslot expired! Playername: <name> SteamID: <steamID>
So hook can be placed on ” [CSMM_Patrons] Donorslot expired! ” for discord notification.
* changed consolecommand remitem: changed commandresponse player entityId to steamId for easier CSMM regex custom variable extraction in custom hooks.

Speaking of hooks: Catalysm wrote an excellent example that shows how incredible powerful the combination of features of CSMM and CPM can be.
This example will show how to create the functionality of giving players the tools to deposit casinoCoins to the virtual CSMM economy. It even shows how to “fix” an exploit that rises while creating this.

Check it out!
https://docs.csmm.app/en/CSMM/advanced-feature-guide.html

**Version 14.4 A18.4 b4 Stable (NOT A18.3 compatible)**

* Changed consolecommand shutdownba: added on demand vehicle removal. Use “shutdownba <minutes> resetvehicles”. All vehicles on map will be removed at restart.
* Added consolecommand af (addfriend): add yourself to friend list of a player without invite or confirmation needed. Works on off,- and online players. To remove from friendlist, use the player list window ingame. Beware that if the player is online, the removal will be shown as a popup on screen (adding is silent/invisible).
* Changed consolecommand wpc (waypointcontrol): fixed wrong number of arguments error response.

**Version 14.3 A18.4 b4 Stable (NOT A18.3 compatible)**

* Added vehicle removal on restart: duping vehicles is still a major problem on MP servers. CPM now offers a way to control that pest. You can enable vehicle removal on restart in CpmSettings.xml :
<Vehicles_RemoveOnRestart>true</Vehicles_RemoveOnRestart>
Default value is false.
When enabled CPM will remove ALL vehicles in the world that are not stored away in containers or backpacks/belt on server restart.
Strongly recommended to make a warning about this functionality in server login confirmation message or by (auto) chat communication. Or there will be tears.

**Version 14.2 A18.4 b4 Stable (NOT A18.3 compatible)**

* Improved “getprefab reset” and resetrwgprefabs: now sleepervolumes in prefabs that got reset manually or automatically, will get despawned and reset too. This will fix the free loot runs on prefabs in which the sleepervolumes were cleared (all killed) and get reset after that. Previously the sleepervolumes would stay cleared until respawn timer would expire again, but the prefab was reset and full of loot again. Now they are all waiting and active again after the prefab resets. Thanks to SylenThunder for reporting.

**Version 14.1 A18.4 b4 Stable (NOT A18.3 compatible)**

* 18.4 b4 Stable compatibility
* Changed sleepers consolecommand: added option to count sleepervolumes in marked area.
* Changed write2log (w2l) consolecommand: added option to add output of a command to log. Now you have full control on what data is written in log. You can use a cronjob for w2l using gt consolecommand for example to be able to make a CSMM custom hook for checking that ingame time and fire one or multiple commands on a specific gametime. Options are limitless.
* New features since 18.3 stable:
    * Sleeperspawn control (with bloodmoon only option)
    * Sleeperrespawn control
    * Anticheat: Spectator mode detection
    * Jail auto-release bugfix
    * Chunkreset consolecommand! Reset chunks on live server

**Version 14.0 A18.4 b4 Experimental (NOT A18.3 Stable compatible)**

* Proudly presenting consolecommand resetchunks: reset chunks point to point (p1,p2) or with radius. Reset chunks to RWG default while server is running with this new command!

**Version 13.9.2 A18.4 b4 Experimental (NOT A18.3 b4 Stable compatible)**

* Jail auto-release bugfix: auto-releasing from jail was not using the new db persistent storage yet, so it failed to actually release the player from jail.

**Version 13.9.1 18.4. b3E (NOT A18.3 b4 Stable compatible) + CPMcc 1.4.0 (2020.02.22)**

* AntiCheat: added Spectator Mode detection. Can be hacked in easily clientside and offers complete invisibility towards other players and zombies/animals. Now CPM will detect unauthorized use.
Configure in CpmSettings.xml: “MaxAdminLevelSpectatorMode” (default permission level 0).
Optional command(s) can be fired on detection. Default is no command “SpectatorModeDetectedCommand “. To enable command(s) just put the command(s) in the setting.
To use multiple commands just seperate them with ;
Supported placeholders: ${entityId}, ${steamId} and ${playerName}.
CPM will write to log upon detection for easy hooking of CSMM custom hooks/discord notifications:

[CSMM_Patrons]Unauthorized SpectatorMode detected on <playerName> (<steamId>) !!!!!
Command example: <SpectatorModeDetectedCommand>ban add ${steamId} 10 years “Hackers not welcome”</SpectatorModeDetectedCommand>

**Version 13.9 A18.3 b4 Stable + CPMcc 1.4.0 (2020.02.21)**

* Added sleeper spawn control: disable sleepers everywhere on the map. CpmSettings.xml ->
<DisableSleepers_Enabled>true</DisableSleepers_Enabled>. To disable sleepers on map only during bloodmoon -> <DisableSleepers_BloodmoonOnly_Enabled>true</DisableSleepers_BloodmoonOnly_Enabled>

* Added sleeper respawn control: configure if sleepers respawn after being cleared or dont ever respawn again.
CpmSettings.xml -> <DisableSleeperRespawn_Enabled>true</DisableSleeperRespawn_Enabled>

**Version 13.8 A18.3 b4 Stable + CPMcc 1.4.0 (2020.01.28)**

* changed consolecommand tprotect: implemented usage of radius when traderprotecting blocks
* CPMcc 1.4.0 is out! Big thanks to Catalysm!
    * Added: icon for playhomes
    * Added: Permission overview of loggedin user in navigation menu
    * Fixed: bug when API endpoints are set to permission level 2000 (map can be used for players now)
    * Fixed: popup message for (claimed) quest POIs
    * Fixed: Claimed quest POIs still show up in quest POI layer

**Version 13.7.1 A18.3 b4 Stable (2020.01.26)**

* Bugfixes in chatgroupcolor (cgc): 
   * adduser: when using name as parameter and player was offline, the player record got added wrongly regarding primairy db key. Adding offline players now requires steamId.
   * listmembers: membership would not be shown
* Persistent playerdata: playername is now saved in persistent playerdata of CPM
* NOT A18.2 compatible
* CPM 13.5.1 is NOT compatible with A18.3

**Version 13.7 A18.3 b4 Stable (2020.01.24)**

* Changed shutdownba consolecommand: added forced server kill if server /hangs/ in the reboot process
* Changed resetplayerdata consolecommand: if player online, cpm will wait 5 secs after the kick before file wipe
* Changed adv. claim lcbFree: implemented ownership. Now also the lcbfree adv. claim sees the steamid in the name of the claim as owner. 
* NOT A18.2 compatible
* CPM 13.5.1 is NOT compatible with A18.3

**Version 13.6 A18.3 b3 Experimental (2019.12.22)**

* Fixed A18.3 b3 Experimental compatibility. CPM 13.5.1 and lower is NOT compatible with A18.3 b3 Experimental

**Version 13.5.1 A18.2 b5 Stable (2019.12.19)**

* Bugfix in consolecommand mv: player to player move made moving player always tp to him/her self.
* Changed consolecommand mv and mvw: playernames params are now case insensitive.

**Version 13.5 A18.2 b5 Stable (2019.12.18)**

* Changed Vehicle adv. claim intrusion handling: warning and handling only when adv. claim intrusion conditions are met (openhours, leveled etc)
* Changed consolecommand mvw: removed partial playername support (still present in chatcommand /mvw) to prevent ambiguous name failures. Still possible to move offline player to waypoint and online player to waypoint.
* Changed consolecommand mv: removed partial playername support (still present in chatcommand /mv) to prevent ambiguous name failures. Still possible to move offline player to offline player, online player to online player, offline player to online player, online player to offline player, offline player to coordinates and online player to coordinates.

**Version 13.4 A18.2 b5 Stable (2019.12.04)**

* A18.2 b5 Stable compatibility
* Changed consolecommand setdeathcount (sdc): added support for offline players.
* Changed consolecommand setplayerstatus (sps): updated command help and description


**Version 13.3 A18.1 b8 Stable + Version 13.3 A18.2 b5 Experimental (2019.11.29)**

* Vehicle adv. claim intrusion handling: warning and handling for all vehicle types instead of only minibike.
* Explicit save of persistent data when whitelisting players on an adv. claim: prevent dataloss when server does crash or not gracefully shuts down.
* Rewrite of falling block prevention system: adapted to new structural integrity in a18.
* moved waypoints to nosql db (existing waypoints not migrated)
* moved player storage to nosql db (existing players not migrated)

* changed remote trading system: fixed trading system not working when using another prefix than "/" for the trading system chatcommands.
* changed shutdownba consolecommand: fixed bloodmoon calculation not to see day 1 as a bloodmoon. Now you can boot your server bloodmoon aware on day 1 again.
* changed "bmonly(fromHour-toHour)_" adv. claim name tag: this was still using the fixed 7 day hordecycle. Changed it to use bloodmoon cycle in settings. Now you can use adv. claims that are only active on bloodmoon again with variable bloodmoon cycle.

**Version 13.1.2 A18.1 b7 Stable (2019.11.13)**

* small change in quest poi protection: made a design booboo by logging if a quest poi doesnt get protected because its excluded from protection. That becomes spammy real quick. No need to update if you dont have exceptions on quest poi protection.

**Version 13.1.1 A18.1 b7 Stable (2019.11.12)**

* changed consolecommand bcheck: fixed out of index range exception when investigating a block by coordinates

**Version 13.1 A18 b155 Stable (2019.11.09) (A18.1 b6 Experimental compatible)**

* changed quest poi protection: added exclusion capability by adding specific quest poi's or types of quest poi's to an exception list (/Saves/ResetRegions/QuestPoi_Exceptions.txt). You can get a poi name with the getprefab consolecommand while standing in/near the poi or with CPMcc 1.3.0 or higher you can use the map to look up specific poi names.
* completely overhauled cpm's webapi's: added native gettrader api and getallpois api and serving maptiles api. All api endpoints have explicit security now. Default permission to use any of them is admin level 0. For getting the latest cpmcc_permissions.xml please delete it from /Saves before starting server again after updating CPM. Or put the permissions in manually and save:
````
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

````
* New CPMcc: Catalysm has adopted to the secured webapi usage and added the use of the new CPM wepapi's gettraders and getallpois. Since CPM's webapi are secured now there is no crossvisiting from allocs map anymore.  Plusside is that the maptiles are served from within CPM now and there is no need to use webtokens anymore in CPMcc. I will stop supporting showing adv. claims/resetregions/questpois/allpois/traders from allocs map. Feel free to play around with the map.js code from alloc to use the new CPM webapi's. I just wont invest in it anymore. CPMcc can be used to make use of all of them.


**Version 13.0 A18 b155 Stable (2019.11.04) (A18.1 b5 Experimental compatible)**

* integrated new CPM Claim Creator Web UI v1.2.2: Small bugfix in CPMcc. Homes were not drawn correctly. To replace, just remove the cpmcc folder from /Mods/1CSMM_Patrons folder and paste the one from this release. Server can keep running. CPM version 12.8 or higher required.

**Version 12.9 A18 b155 Stable (2019.11.04) (A18.1 b5 Experimental compatible)**

* integrated new CPM Claim Creator Web UI v1.2.1: Catalysm has built in webapi usage of the new CPM webapi's of player beds and quest poi's. Now you can show playerbeds, questpoi's and questpoi's with bed/lcb only on the CPMcc map. To replace, just remove the cpmcc folder from /Mods/1CSMM_Patrons folder and paste the one from this release. Server can keep running. CPM version 12.8 or higher required.

**Version 12.8 A18 b155 Stable (2019.11.03) (A18.1 b5 Experimental compatible)**

* changed consolecommand getprefab: added Quest POI status to the info getprefab gives about the prefab you're investigating.
* changed webapi for playerbeds: added status Active (bedroll deactivates after expirytime ends) to response
* added webapi for quest POI's: webapi for getting all prefabs that can be chosen for a quest including bedlcbonly filter
* changed quest POI protection:  now taking bedroll deadzone size and expiration status of a bedroll into account. Adapted completely to how TFP code checks if a poi can be selected for questing. This means a bedroll's deadzone cannot touch a quest prefab. Even if it's not in it. Exactly like the claimed area of a landclaim.
Changed the strings for responding to poi protection interventions because the bedroll/landclaim doesnt nescesarely need to be IN a prefab to get denied now. Only active for new installs. Please change your strings manually in CpmStrings.xml:
````
<QuestPoiProtection_LcbMessage>[F7FE2E]Claim area overlaps a quest POI! You are not allowed to place a LCB here![-]</QuestPoiProtection_LcbMessage>
<QuestPoiProtection_BedMessage>[F7FE2E]Bed(roll) deadzone overlaps a quest POI! You are not allowed to place a bed(roll) here! Bed(roll) deactivated.[-]</QuestPoiProtection_BedMessage>
````
* changed map.js: fixed correct representation of bedroll deadzone size for showing playerbeds. The deadzone gamesetting determines the size of the rectangle drawn. Active bedrolls are green and inactive are red now. Added code to show quest POI's and quest POI's with bed/lcb only to use the new quest POI webapi

**Version 12.7 A18 b155 Stable (2019.11.02) (A18.1 b5 Experimental compatible)**

* Added Quest POI Protection: prevent players from placing LCB's and/or bed(roll)s in a POI (prefab) that can be selected for a quest by the game. No more blocked quests because of LCB's and/or bed(roll)s present in that POI. Enabled by default. Use QuestPoiProtection_Enabled in CpmSettings.xml to en,- or disable. Customizable strings for detecting placed bed(roll)s and LCB's in CpmStrings.xml (QuestPoiProtection_LcbMessage and QuestPoiProtection_BedMessage).
* Added consolecommand deactivatebed (db): deactivate a players bed(roll) by this consolecommand.
* Added webapi for reporting bed(roll)s: for querying the game for active bedrolls via webapi.
* Changed map.js: added code to use the new bedroll webapi for displaying player beds on allocs webmap.


**Version 12.6 A18 b155 Stable (2019.10.28) (A18.1 b5 Experimental compatible)**

* changed consolecommand resetrwgprefabs (rrp):
     * added count of prefabs that are marked for reset in response when running the command.
     * added parameter "stop": when running "rrp stop" the active reset prefabs run will be terminated.
     * added parameter "status": when running "rrp status" it will show if there is an active reset prefabs run and if so, how many prefabs are awaiting reset on a full chunkload.
* changed "getprefab reset" and resetprefabs functionality: fixed landclaimblock/bed(roll) icon still showing for owning player after resetting a prefab with a landclaimblock/bed(roll) present.
* changed consolecommand shutdownba: fixed the possibillity of an infinite loop while CPM was waiting for all players to have gracefully disconnected. It now has a failsafe loop breaker which will do a shutdown after 5 seconds of waiting regardless if there are still stuck connections.


**Version 12.5.1 A18 b155 Stable (2019.10.27) (A18.1 b2 Experimental compatible)**

* Fixed chatcommand /bag and consolecommand tp2bag: fixed the player getting stuck in ground after a tp to dropped backpack position in some circumstances.


**Version 12.5 A18 b155 Stable (2019.10.26) (A18.1 b2 Experimental compatible)**

* Added chatcommand /bed: will take you to your active bed(roll). Default permission = 0. Use CpmSettings.xml or ccp (chatcommandpermissions) to assign permissions.
* Improved reset prefabs functionality: Little quality of life improvement. Reset prefabs exclusions can now be added after the resetcommand has been given and the active reset run will considder the new exclusion(s). Could be used if, for some reason, a prefab has troubles resetting (added logline if that happens).

All reset prefabs features once again for reference:

Use consolecommand rrp (resetrwgprefabs) or "shutdownba [minutes] resetprefabs" for resetting prefabs. No need for server to be empty. Use at your will.

There are 3 ways of using exclusions on which prefabs should be reset or not:
* By adding the unique prefab name to the exceptions file (/Saves/ResetRegions/ResetPrefabs_Exceptions.txt. You can get the unique name of any prefab on your map by standing in/near it and do consolecommand getprefab. Use "name" (ex. Prefab bombshelter_lg_01.877) of the prefab to exclude only that specific prefab from resetting when running the new command.

* By adding a type of prefab to the exceptions file (/Saves/ResetRegions/ResetPrefabs_Exceptions.txt. You can get the type of prefab on your map by standing in/near it and do consolecommand getprefab. Use "filename" (ex. funeral_home_01) of the prefab to exclude all prefabs on your map that are of that type. You can also check your /Data/Prefabs folder for available types. Just use the .tts fiilename without the extention.

* By setting if claimed prefabs should be excluded from resetting. In CpmSettings.xml you can set ResetPrefabs_ExcludeClaimedPrefabs to true/false. By default (for safety) all claimed prefabs are excluded from resetting when running the new command. When you want to allow players to setup base in prefabs and still be able to reset all other prefabs, you should leave it true. When you dont allow setup bases in prefabs,, you can set it to false and all claimed prefabs will also be reset when running the new command (claimblocks will be removed too).

Adding prefabs to the exclusion list can also be done ingame with the getprefab consolecommand:
* "getprefab exclude": for excluding the specific prefab you are in/near 
* "getprefab exclude type": for excluding all prefabs of the same type as the prefab you are in/near 


**Version 12.3 A18 b152 Experimental (2019.10.21)**

* Changed shutdownba x resetprefabs: added more errorhandling and extended logging. Moved the code so its absolutely guaranteed there can be no players connected or connecting while in progress.

* Changed consolecommand getprefab: added parameter "exclude" and "exclude type". Use the command for excluding the specific prefab you are in/near (exclude) or excluding all prefabs of the same type as the prefab you are in/near (exclude type) from being reset.

* Added consolecommand gc: invoke the .NET garbagecollector on demand and free up some memory.


**Version 12.2 A18 b152 Experimental (2019.10.19)**

* Fixed consolecommand resetrwgprefabs (rrp): fixed the undoing of prefab resets for prefabs that have not been visited yet after a prefab reset when the server reboots.

* Changed consolecommand shutdownba: added parameter "resetprefabs".  Now its possible to combine a server reboot with a RWG prefab reset. Combine the maintenance tasks for convenience.


**Version 12.1 A18 b149 Experimental (2019.10.16)**

* Added consolecommand resetrwgprefabs (rrp): Welcome to the next level of map maintenance! Reset all RWG generated prefabs on your map to RWG virgin state. No more wiping complete region files for getting your cities (and all other RWG prefabs) clean and in a virgin RWG state. Just one command for resetting the prefabs and prefabs only. There are 3 ways of using exclusions on which prefabs should be reset or not:

    + By adding the unique prefab name to the exceptions file (/Saves/ResetRegions/ResetPrefabs_Exceptions.txt. You can get the unique name of any prefab on your map by standing in/near it and do consolecommand getprefab. Use "name" (ex. Prefab bombshelter_lg_01.877) of the prefab to exclude only that specific prefab from resetting when running the new command.

    + By adding a type of prefab to the exceptions file (/Saves/ResetRegions/ResetPrefabs_Exceptions.txt.  You can get the type of prefab on your map by standing in/near it and do consolecommand getprefab. Use "filename" (ex. funeral_home_01) of the prefab to exclude all prefabs on your map that are of that type. You can also check your /Data/Prefabs folder for available types. Just use the .tts fiilename without the extention.

    + By setting if claimed prefabs should be excluded from resetting. In CpmSettings.xml you can set ResetPrefabs_ExcludeClaimedPrefabs to true/false. By default (for safety) all claimed prefabs are excluded from resetting when running the new command. When you want to allow players to setup base in prefabs and still be able to reset all other prefabs, you should leave it true. When you dont allow setup bases in prefabs,, you can set it to false and all claimed prefabs will also be reset when running the new command (claimblocks will be removed too).

For the reset to work correctly the server needs to be empty. My advise is to set up a CSMM cronjob on a time 
you know the server will be unoccupied or has low playercount. The command will automatically kick all online 
players with a configurable kick string if run when there are players online. In CpmStrings.xml you can set the 
kick string (<ResetPrefabs_KickMessage>RWG prefabs are being reset...</ResetPrefabs_KickMessage>).

* Changed consolecommand targetedhorde (th): added "all" parameter to send a targeted horde to all online players at once.


**Version 12.0 A18 b139 Experimental (2019.10.07)**

* A18b139 Experimental compatibility (codebreaking changes so not compatible with A17 and lower)
* Added consolecommand ownvehicle: take ownership of any ingame vehicle (bicycle, minibike, motorcycle, jeep, gyrocopter, blimp and helicopter)


**Version 11.0 A17.4 b4 Stable (2019.08.16)**

* Added settings for individually enabling/disabling gamemessages (GMSG) for PlayerJoined,, PlayerLeft, PlayerDied and PlayerKilled.

    `<GMSG_PlayerJoined_Enabled>true</GMSG_PlayerJoined_Enabled>`

    `<GMSG_PlayerLeft_Enabled>true</GMSG_PlayerLeft_Enabled>`

    `<GMSG_PlayerDied_Enabled>true</GMSG_PlayerDied_Enabled>`

    `<GMSG_PlayerKilled_Enabled>true</GMSG_PlayerKilled_Enabled>`
* Added configurable response strings for use on arresting player.

    `<Arrest_Notification>[00FF00]You have been jailed by an Admin![-]</Arrest_Notification>`
    
    `<Arrest_Notification_Timed>[00FF00]You have been jailed by an Admin! You will be released automatically in {minutes} minutes[-]</Arrest_Notification_Timed>`


**Version 10.9 A17.4 b4 Stable (2019.08.09)**

* Added webapihandlers and security layers for getting online players and landclaimblocks
* Catalysm integrated online players and landclaimblocks into CPMcc using the new apis. Now you can view them on map while creating resetregions/adv. claims.
* Catalysm completely redid the look and feel of CPMcc. Very slick. I really like it.

**Version 10.8 A17.4 b4 Stable (2019.08.06)**

* Integration of adv. claim creator made by Catalysm. Now the creator webinterface will be hosted from within CPM itself! Just browse to allocs map and add one to the port and you're good to go. Make all types of advanced claims and reset regions with this superhandy gui. Many thanks to Catalysm for making this! Make sure you fill in your webtoken and password (you can use the one allready created for CSMM or make a new one in webpermissions.xml) in "Server Settings". This will be only used to access allocs webmap. Default permission for creating claims = 0. If you want that permission to be higher just uncomment the "cpmcc.createadvclaim" permission in cpmcc_permissions.xml in your /Saves folder and set it to the permission level you want. For creating claims you MUST login via Steam (lower left) to be validated for permissions.

**Version 10.7.1 A17.4 b4 Stable (2019.06.28)**

* Small addition to new eoc (executeonclient) console command: added "all" parameter to execute a local command on all connected clients.

**Version 10.7 A17.4 b4 Stable (2019.06.28)**

* Implemented new console command eoc (executeonclient): gives the ability to remotely execute local client only commands on a player. Some commands are designed to be allowed to be executed ONLY on a local client. This command will remove that restriction and let owners/admins execute those type of commands remotely (servermanager, telnet etc). The player does NOT have to have permissions set for executing the command. eoc will take care of that.

Example of commands that will become available for remote exectution by owners/admins: sg (sg OptionsFieldOfViewNew x!), automove, cm, dm, givequest, removequest, giveself, giveselfxp, buff, debuff, exhausted, gfx, dms, bents, memcl, pois, settempunit, screeneffect, showhits, starve, thirsty, xui, spawnsupplycrate etc etc


**Version 10.6 A17.4 b4 Stable (2019.06.21)**

* Implemented new advanced claim type LcbFree: control abillity to place LCB's within the boundaries of the lcbfree adv. claim. Allow to place LCB's by accesslevel and/or whitelist. If not allowed to place LCB, it will be removed and put back in player inventory. Use lcbfree as type when creating this advanced claim. Violation message is configurable in CpmStrings.xml (AdvClaims_LcbFree).
* Implemented lcbfree claims requesthandler in CPM's webapi to be able to query the defined lcbfree adv. claims.
Updated allocs webmap map.js. Added abillity to display the new lcbfree adv. claims on allocs webmap. Get it here.


**Version 10.5 A17.4 b4 Stable (2019.06.15)**

* Implemented a workaround (asynchronous removal and giving back plus 0,0 LCB's exclusion) in reset regions auto removal (and give back) of LCB's. Strange LCB's appearing on 0,0 will be excluded from being handled as they disrupt the system.
* Extended error handling in normal, reversed, timed, leveled, portal, hostilefree, openhours, notify, command and playerlevel advanced claims. The sys will keep spinning even when impossible advanded claims are created. This way the system keeps its maximum flexibility but wont bork if the flexibility leads to impossible advanced claims.


**Version 10.4 A17.4 b4 Stable (2019.05.19)**

* Improved consolecommand getprefab: return RWG prefab center coordinates, return RWG prefab size, excluded support for Navezgane city block prefabs and added automatic chunkloading for large RWG prefab resets.

**Version 10.3 A17.3 b18 Stable (2019.05.13)**

* Improved consolecommand getprefab: a player demolished a POI on your server? Someone made a base in a POI (prefab) (even though not allowed)? Reset POI's to RWG default with one command while you are in it and your POI is as fresh as it was at world generation. Just do command getprefab reset


**Version 10.2 A17.3 b18 Experimental(2019.05.11)**

* Added consolecommand getprefab: ever wondered how the POI you are in is called? Now you can get that info by running getprefab when standing in (or close to) a POI (prefab). 
Info returned: Name, filename, if the POI contains a player bed or lcb and the number of sleepervolumes that are defined in the prefabfile on disk.


**Version 10.1 A17.3 b18 Experimental(2019.05.10)**

* Added consolecommand sleepers: remove sleeper volumes from a defined area. Sleepervolumes are deleted instantly. Spawned sleepers can take up to 30 seconds to be removed.
* Changed console command bundo: removes sleeper volumes (if present) on bundo. Sleepervolumes are deleted instantly. Spawned sleepers can take up to 30 seconds to be removed.


**Version 10.0 A17.3 b18 Experimental(2019.05.09)**

* Added consolecommand lbuffs (listbuffs): list all available ingame buffs or search buffs with a specific (sub)string
* Added consolecommand lpbuffs (listplayerbuffs): list all active buffs on a specific player or all online players.
Use vanilla commands buffplayer and debuffplayer icw.  the technical buffname returned by lbuffs or lpbuffs to buff or debuff players.


**Version 9.9 A17.3 b18 Experimental(2019.05.08)**

* Reworked chunkreloading on using worldedit commands. No more falling through world or flickering when chunks on clients need a reload after using worldedit commands!!
Affected commands: brender, bdup, fblock, brepblock,, bundo, tprotect, unlockall


**Version 9.8 A17.3 b18 Experimental(2019.05.08)**

* A17.3 b18 compatibility
* Bugfix in consolecommand ocn (override chatname): when listing players with overridden chatnames, it would fail if player is not saved to allocs bin. Now it will show steamid of player if not present in allocs bin.
* Added sleepervolume support to consolecommand brender: by default any sleepervolumes defined in a prefab will get implemented on brender. Optional omitting of sleepervolume implementation by using parameter "nosleepers".
* A17.3 b18 has codebreaking changes and is therefore not compatible with CPM 9.7 and lower. 


**Version 9.7 A17.2 b27 Stable (2019.04.14)**

* New anticheat feature damage detection on entities: CPM can now trigger when a configured minimum amount of damage is inflicted on entities (other players, zombies, animals and vehicles).  Default trigger is 5000 (<DamageDetection_MinAmountDamage>5000</DamageDetection_MinAmountDamage>) 5000 is the amount of damage that the default admin tools/weapons inflict on entities, so best to keep the value at that minimum. Very often used damage hacks (+99999) will also get caught then.
To enable command(s) on detection just put the command(s) in the setting <DamageDetection_DetectedCommand></DamageDetection_DetectedCommand>. 
To use multiple commands just seperate them with ;

Supported placeholders: ${entityId}, ${steamId} and ${playerName}

Example: 
<DamageDetection_DetectedCommand>ban add ${steamId} 10 years "Hackers not welcome"</DamageDetection_DetectedCommand>

A logline will be written on detection for easy hooking with CSMM: 

[CSMM_Patrons]damageDetection: Player <playerName> (<steamId>) triggered damage detection! Damage done: <amountOfDamage>


**Version 9.6.7 A17.2 b27 Stable (2019.04.08)**

* Switched the order of group chat coloring and individual chat coloring. If a player has both individual,- and group chat colors, the individual color wins and will be used in chat.


**Version 9.6.6 A17.2 b27 Stable (2019.03.13)**

* Added optional command(s) to fire when detecting unauthorized GodMode usage: Add command(s) to CpmSettings (GodModeDetectedCommand) that will fire when a player has been detected using GodMode. 
Default is no command <GodModeDetectedCommand /> (this means empty xml value and is the same as <GodModeDetectedCommand></GodModeDetectedCommand>)
To enable command(s) just put the command(s) in the setting. To use multiple commands just seperate them with ;

Supported placeholders: ${entityId}, ${steamId} and ${playerName}

Example: <GodModeDetectedCommand>ban add ${steamId} 10 years "Hackers not welcome"</GodModeDetectedCommand>


**Version 9.6.5 A17.2 b27 Stable (2019.03.11)**

* Added custom flying vehicle support to cvc (checkvehiclecontent) console command: Helicopterclass and blimpclass (jetpack) are available for checking contents.
* Improved cgc (chatgroupcolor): cgc will list steamId if player has never been on server (aka not present in Allocs persistentdata bin)


**Version 9.6.4 A17.2 b27 Stable (2019.03.11)**

* Added custom flying vehicle support to flying detection. Helicopterclass and blimpclass (jetpack) are now excluded from detection trigger if player is using them.


**Version 9.6.3 A17.2 b27 Stable (2019.03.10)**

* Added check if player is on gyrocopter when detected flying.


**Version 9.6.2 A17.2 b27 Stable (2019.03.10)**

* Forgot to check if a player is fully spawned on flying detection. This could lead to false positives on teleporting and/or any other spawn-in.

**Version 9.6.1 A17.2 b27 Stable (2019.03.10)**

* Improved command shutdownba: shutdownba will now asynchronously handle worldsaving, playerkicking and server shutdown. This will ensure that no chunks/inventories will get corrupted on save and shutdown.
* Added support for non vanilla quality values on giveplus command: now you can use giveplus on servers that have mods installed that changed the vanilla quality system.

**Version 9.6 A17.2 b27 Stable (2019.03.08)**

* Added anticheat GodMode detection: specify the maximum admin level in CpmSettings.xml (MaxAdminLevelGodMode (default=0)) which is allowed to use GodMode on server and all players with higher level (or no admin) will get reported in log for using unauthorized GodMode. Logline: [CSMM_Patrons]Unauthorized GodMode detected on {playerName} ({steamId}) !!!!!. NoClip detection becomes obsolete with this functionality as the only way to NoClip is by using GodMode.
* Added anticheat flying detection: disabled by default (CpmSettings.xml: PlayerFlying_TriggerHeight = 0). When specifying a PlayerFlying_TriggerHeight > 0, players will get reported in log for being at configured PlayerFlying_TriggerHeight or higher (=flying). Use CpmSettings.xml: PlayerFlying_MaxAdminLevelFlying for specifying the maximum admin level that is allowed to fly without being reported. Logline: [CSMM_Patrons]Player {playerName} ({steamId}) seems to be flying !!!!!
You can use CSMM custom discord notifications to be warned in discord when a hacker is active!

**Version 9.5 A17.2 b27 Stable (2019.03.05)**

* Added events for:
    * Player level up
    * Player animal kill
    * Player zombie kill

The events can be used by CSMM's event trigger.

**Version 9.4 A17.2 b27 Stable (2019.02.28)**

* A17.2 b27 compatibility


**Version 9.3.2 A17.2 b20 Experimental (2019.02.18)**

* Changed maximum chatlength to be a global setting in CpmSettings.xml instead of a per player setting. Its disabled by default (MaxChatLength = 0). For enabling, just put the number of characters in there you want to define as maximum length for a chatmessage.

**Version 9.3.1 A17.2 b20 Experimental (2019.02.16)**

* Small fix for bloodmoon aware shutdown (shutdownba): forgot to let the MustDelay check look at new bloodmoonfrequency setting for determining if the shutdown should be delayed until after configured time when bloodmoon ended. Also when a bloodmoonrange is set higher than 0 in serverconfig.xml, the bloodmoon awareness will be shut off, as bloodmoons will be random.

**Version 9.2 A17.2 b20 Experimental (2019.02.09)**

Removed oldlcb system: functionality is in-game now
fixed /day7 to handle new random bloodmoons
fixed nighttime announcer to handle new random bloodmoons
removed option Hordecycle for nightime announcer
random bloodmoon string to CpmStrings.xml
fixed object type changes in a17.2

**Version 9.1.1 A17.1 b9 Stable (2019.02.06)**

* Fixed exploit in oldlcb system: Since version 9.1 the oldlcb system will have all your active landclaim blocks prevent sleepers from spawning, but i forgot to check if the sleepervolume was cleared before preventing the sleeper spawns. This version fixes that exploit. Now sleeperspawns are only prevented by all active landclaim blocks if the sleepervolume has been fully cleared. 


**Version 9.1 A17.1 b9 Stable (2019.02.05)**

* Improved oldlcb system: all your active landclaim blocks will now prevent sleepers from spawning again instead of only the one placed last. 


**Version 9.0 A17.1 b9 Stable (2019.02.01)**

* Improved reset unclaimed regions functionality: consolecommand resetunclaimedregionsnow and "shutdownba <minutes> resetunclaimed" will now take server configured landclaim size into account when determining regions that should not be reset. With considderation of landclaim size, any overlap from claimed area with a region will mark the region as claimed. No more cutting playerbases in half when using this functionality.


**Version 8.9.2 A17.1 b9 Stable (2019.01.27)**

* Proudly presenting the remote trading system: let players trade with eachother remotely through a trading chest. Unstress your server by not letting the endless tp-ing from and to a "lobby" happening only to let players trade with eachother there. It makes use of the underground postal pipeline system that was in the world long before the apocalypse ^^. Full support for mods. The chatcommand /rtc has a default permission level of 0. If you want to use on your server for players apply permission 1000 to the rtc chatcommand by doing consolecommand ccp rtc 1000.

Trading process:
Registering a secure storage chest as tradingchest is step one.
This can be done unlimited and anywhere, but last registered chest is the actual active trading chest.
This means the system can also be used when underway and away from base.

Registering a tradingchest:
* Place a secure storage chest, stand on it and do /rtc (register tradingchest) in chat.

Done your chest is now up and running as active tradingchest. The only time you have to stand on your trading chest is when registering it.

* 2 players put the stuff they want to trade in their tradingchest
* each player has to "offer" his/her trade to the other by /rti <(partial) playername>
  After putting the trade in the chest, do the chatcommand for releasing trading items /rti <(partial) playername>
* the players get a quality colorcoded overview (including attached mods) in chat of the offer the other player made.
* check the offer and if you agree to it, you can approve it by /ati <(partial) playername> (approve trading items)
* if both players have approved the deal, the contents of the chests will be swapped and deal is done.
* if one or both of the players dont approve of the deal they can just cancel it by /cti (cancel trading items).
* in case you are in active trading process (chest is inaccessable to you) and you forgot what you offered again, you can do /lti (list trading items) in chat and your offer will be listed in chat again.

**Version 8.8.2 A17.1 b9 Stable (2019.01.26)**

* Added possibility to consolecommand mv (moveplayer) to accept entity,- and steamId instead of only (partial)playernames. This to prevent losing characters on url encoding.
When using for creating a custom CSMM command with fo paramter for friendsonly teleport allowance, please be aware that it still supports moving to offline player. Strongly recommended to use consolecommand w2l in the same custom CSMM command  to write a logline with the fact that a player did tp to a friend. If he/she was offline and teleporting player got into base with the teleportcommand and did some booboo, you will know about it.


**Version 8.8.1 A17.1 b9 Stable (2019.01.20)**

* Added possibility to consolecommand mvw (move2waypoint) to accept entity,- and steamId instead of only (partial)playernames. This to prevent losing characters on url encoding.
* Updated map.js to reflect latest webmap version of Alloc. If you have upgraded to version 31, get your new map.js here to show adv. claims / reset regions.


**Version 8.8 A17.1 b9 Stable (2019.01.16)**

* Major bugfix on wi (wipeinventory): The way of cleaning the equipment, bag and inventory was done by wrong approach causing inventory and bag troubles. Strong advice to upgrade if planning on using this functionality!
Improved consolecommand cgc (chatgroupcolor): now its possible to manage offline players with groupcolor management.
* Compatible with A17 b240 (except rst (resetskilltree)), A17.1 b8 (except rst (resetskilltree)) and A17.1 b9


**Version 8.7 A17.1 b8 E (2019.01.15)**

* Improved Reset Regions landclaimblock detection: LCB cleanup will now calculate any overlaps/intersects with reset regions. If a LCB is placed and it overlaps a reset region based on server landclaimblock size, the player will get (CpmStrings.xml configurable) warning in chat that he/she is claiming to close to a reset region with the danger of part(s) of the base getting wiped on a reset. The landclaimblock placed will be put back in players inventory. 

**Version 8.6 A17.1 b8 E (2019.01.14)**

* Improved DonorSlots console command ds: A player made a donation? Just add to donorslot list by ds command and specify days bought. CPM will figure out if its a new donor,, expired donor or a donor that is still active and has time left on his/her donorship thus adding time to the end of donorship date/time
* Added console command wi (wipeinventory): born out of the unremovable quest from inventory bug. With this command you completely wipe a players bag, belt and equipment. Make a custom CSMM command with permissions for all players to let players fix the problem themselves.

**Version 8.5 A17.1 b8 E (2019.01.12)**

* Introducing DonorSlots system: a system to be able to set a donorbuffer. This buffer will determine how many of the max server slots are reserved for donors and admins only. It will not allow connection if trying to connect and server is virtually full. The connection is not even finished so ultrafast recognition and kicking. With consolecommand (ds) for managing donorslots and settings through console. Fully configurable by xml too (CpmDonorSlots.xml). Configurable strings for DonorSlots in CpmStrings.xml for kicking normal players on buffer full, kicking expired donors on buffer full, welcome message in game for donors and donors that have expired donorship.

**Version 8.4 A17.1 b8 E (2019.01.10)**

* shutdownba consolecommand  now accepts 0 as parameter for immediate kick of all players and shutdown.
* Added console command wpc (waypointcontrol): add/remove/list CPM waypoints with this console command.
* Added fo (friendsonly) parameter to mv console command. Now you can force the tp to be only allowed if target is a friend in-game. Very usefull for CSMM custom command for letting players teleport to eachother.


**Version 8.3 A17 b240 Stable (2019.01.08)**

Improved rst (resetskilltree) console command: Under circumstances the .bak → .ttp rollback mechanism of TFP would undo the skilltree reset. CPM will now say "No you dont!" to the rollback if it tries.
Added option to PVE zone kill punishment: now its possible to prevent punishment on PVE violation if offender and victim are in-game friends. When adding NPF (Not Punish Friends) to the PVE zone claimname, any violation in that zone will not trigger punishment if killing an in-game friend.

**Version 8.2 A17 b240 Stable (2019.01.06)**

* Fixed bug in PVE zone kill detection. Every hit from automatic weapon fire after death of victim is considdered another kill by TFP code. Fixed that every kill will trigger only one PVE violation.
* Added consolecommand w2l (write2log): now owners/admins/CSMM can write anything and everything they like to the server log. Usefull for custom triggering of discord notifications on log filter.


**Version 8.1.1 A17 b240 Stable (2019.01.01)**

* Bugfixes to new /aaf, /raf chatcommands and wlf consolecommand. First friend got added repeatedly.


**Version 8.1 A17 b240 Stable (2018.12.31)**

* Added chatcommand /aaf for advanced claims system. Whitelist all your ingame friends for your advanced claim(s) with just one chatcommand!
* Added chatcommand /raf for advanced claims system. Remove all your ingame friends from your advanced claim(s) whitelist(s) with just one chatcommand!
* Added consolecommand wlf (whitelistfriends): console command for adding/removing a player's ingame friends to/from their advanced claim(s) whitelist(s)

A happy newyear to all and best wishes for 2019 for everyone!!!

**Version 8.0 A17 b240 Stable (2018.12.28)**

* Changed: /bubble chatcommand and protect consolecommand to use despawn instead of high damage kills. Way less stressfull for server.
Oldlcb system is back! I managed to make autoremoval of LCB's in resetregions, grablcb, resetunclaimed and rlp2 consolecommands work with both old,- and new lcbsystem.


**Version 7.9.1 A17 b240 Stable (2018.12.23)**

* Fixed: bug in preventing new normal advanced claims intersecting with existing normal advanced claims. It blocked other types of advanced claims also.


**Version 7.9 A17 b240 Stable (2018.12.23)**

* Fixed WebApi always returning an empty json array on normal advanced claim request.
* Improved normal advanced claims: they cant overlap anymore. Now its safe to create a CSMM custom command to let players create base protection by advanced claim themselves.
* Reset unclaimed regions system: regions that contain a normal advanced claim (base protection) will also be considdered claimed and not be wiped.


**Version 7.8 (2018.12.21)**

* Fixed consolecommand  resetskilltree (rst) to use new costs for attibutes (again) to get all skillpoints spent back to the player on a skilltree reset. Fixed resetskilltree: ProgressionValue object property change by TFP.
* Changed consolecommand giveplus: when using only quantity parameter and the item has quality, a random quality will be chosen. If item has modslots, random mod(s) will be given. If using qualtiy parameter, the item will have the specified quality and if item has modslots they will be kept empty.
* Changed consolecommand checkloot to be able to handle and report existing mods on items with mods.
b240 compatibility.


**Version 7.7 (2018.12.18)**

* TFP removed level gates for attribute buying. Instead the attributes become more expensive the higher the level of the attribute. Changed the spent skillpoints calculation in consolecommand resetskilltree (rst) to reflect the new costs and get all skillpoints back to the player on a skilltree reset.


**Version 7.6 (2018.12.18)**

* No changes. Just a recompile/repack with b231 binaries. In case of strange behaviour or problems, first install this version.


**Version 7.5 (2018.12.17)**

* fixed worldedit commands to not null ref on sleepervolumes: Affected → bdup, brepblock and brender
fixed rlp2, grablcb and auto LCB removal on reset regions to function with new LCB system.
* removed oldlcb patching: New LCB system is so heavily intergrated in core game code, i give up bringing old claim system back
* improved auto removal of LCB placed on reset region: Claimblock will be returned to player


**Version 7.4.1 (2018.12.16)**

* Added consolecommand sayadmin: send a chatmessage with custom sendername to a group of players based on permissionlevel. Send a chatmessage to mods and admins only at once? 
Do sayadmin MyChatName 1 "Hey fellas, watch player X. Looks like he is duping". Or just to admins level 0 →  sayadmin MyChatName 0 "Hey fellas, watch player X. Looks like he is duping".


**Version 7.4 (2018.12.15)**

* Added consolecommand resetskilltree (rst): reset the skill tree of a player. Will set all attributes, skills and perks to default and give all skillpoints spent back to the player. This makes it possible to redo the complete skilltree on demand without losing any other progress made ingame for a player. Try out other "play styles" while keeping other progress made!
re-enabled consolecommand lps (listplayerskill): list all levels of player's attributes, skills and perks.


**Version 7.3 (2018.12.14)**

* Added consolecommand resetplayerdata (rpd): reset a player. Deletes .ttp, .map and .bak files of a player. Resetting him/her to new player state.
* Added webapi interface: Resetregions / advanced claims on webmap make use of the new webapi, making it suitable for displaying reset/claim data on mulitiple server instances. Thanks to Alloc for the base code of his webapi.
Make sure to update your map.js to hook into the new webapi. 


**Version 7.2 (2018.12.12)**

* A17 b221 compatibility

**Version 7.1 (2018.12.07)**

* Added support for all new vehicle types to consolecommand lce (listcustomentity): filters added → jeep, bicycle, gyrocopter, motorcycle
* Renamed consolecommand cbc (checkbikecontent) to cvc (checkvehiclecontent) and added support for all new vehicletypes → jeep, bicycle, gyrocopter, motorcycle. cvc will report owner if the vehicle has been locked.
* Fixed consolecommand getbike to adapt to TFP's new implementation of bikeownership. Not locked is NO owner.
* Added consolecommands for getting all new vehicletypes to their owner: getjeep, getbicycle, getmotorcycle and getgyrocopter.


**Version 7.0 (2018.12.05)**

* Added consolecommand repairtrees (rt): check map for bugged trees and report them. Do repairtrees repair to repair the exploit trees. Note: this will only fix the exploitable trees that have a damageindicator when hitting them. The ghosttrees that are not exploitable but also non interactable cannot be repaired.
* Added some more logic to heartbeat thread aborting. When external servermanagers (nonVanilla, nonCPM) do a shutdown routine witin a thread of their own there could be circumstances of the thread not closing down properly. With this addition i hope to mitigate that risk.


**Version 6.9 (2018.12.02)**

* Added old LCB system back!!! (through command oldlcb): multiple LCB's per player possible again with protection active. Strongly recommended to activate when using resetregion/resetunclaimed functionality.
The system is off by default. To activate, do console command oldlcb true. Maximum number of active LCB's is configurable and default set to 5.
* Fixed PVE punishment trigger going off when one killed oneself in a PVE zone.


**Version 6.8 (2018.11.27)**

* Added arresttimer to arrest consolecommand: add parameter in minutes that indicates how long the player should be in jail before getting automatically released. Text for release message can be altered via setstring consolecommand or editting CpmStrings.xml
* Added filterpossibillity to /day7  stats and fps info. They can be indiviually disabled by entering "off" in CpmStrings.xml for Day7_Stats and/or Day7_Fps.
* Fixed nullrefs on chatmessages when player without CPM persistent player object sends a messsage.

**Version 6.7 (2018.11.26)**

* Added bloodmoon activation for all types of advanced claims. This makes it possible to let advanced claims only be active during bloodmoons within a defined timespan. Its implemented by claimname. Use prefix "bmonly(fromHour-toHour)_" to tag a claim as bloodmoon only between fromHour and toHour. Ex. bmonly(20-7)_NoEnemies: this will activate this claim every bloodday from 20:00 until after bloodmoon 07:00. All claim types supported.
* Changed data for Chatcolor, Chatmute, MaxChatLenght and HideChatCommandPlayers to be stored in CPM's persistent bin. They were still saved in Allocs persistent bin which has a prob with keeping the data persistent atm.
* Migration of resetregion notification strings to CpmStrings.xml. mrr console command can still be used to set it. But now it can also be altered by editting CpmStrings.xml or setstring consolecommand.


**Version 6.6 (2018.11.25)**

* Added tag on every consolecommand response that indicates a functional error. CSMM will now be able to distinguish successfull from unsuccessfull command execution.
* Added stats to /day7 chatcommand: Fully configurable with setstring consolecommand or editting /saves/CpmStrings.xml. Server FPS, nr of players and nr of zombies will be shown.
* Added subcommand to hccp for listing enabled hidden chatprefixes.


**Version 6.5 (2018.11.24)**

* Fixed backend logging for chatcommands that were hidden by hccp consolecommand. CPM still sent the chatlog in old (A16) format, rendering custom CSMM commands not working. Chat log is now A17 format and custom CSMM commands are picked up again.


**Version 6.4 (2018.11.23)**

* Fixed giveplus consolecommand. Only accepting new quality tier values now.
Added suffix to chatname when chatting in party or friends chat with overridden chatname or colored chat,- name/text ( (Friends) and (Party) ). Now its always clear from what channel the chat came.


**Version 6.3 (2018.11.22)**

* Fixed teleportplayerhome consolecommand
* Fixed and re-enabled unlockall consolecommand
* Fixed Party/Friends chat when using overridden or colored chatname
* Fixed multiple gameinstances persistent data usage. Persistent bin will be in gameseed savegame folder again


**Version 6.2 (2018.11.21)**

* Fixed advanced claim hostilefree. All hostile entities will despawn again in hostilefree advanced claim.


**Version 6.1 (2018.11.21)**

* Due to some strange behaviour in A17 when getting the savegame directory for a gameseed, persistentdata could not be saved. This version fixes that. All CPM settings can be saved again and be persistent.


**Version 6.0 (2018.11.20)**

* A17 Experimental Compatible version


**Version 5.39 (2018.11.11)**

* Added

    * chatcommand /day7: shows bloodmooninfo with time awareness. Fully configurable with new setstring consolecommand.
    Time awareness strings of /day7:
    Day7_bloodmoonWarningB4Four = command /day7 issued on bloodday before 04:00 message
    Day7_bloodmoonWarningAfterFour = command /day7 issued on bloodday after 04:00 message
    Day7_bloodmoonWarningDuring = command /day7 issued on active bloodmoon night (after midnight) message 
    Day7_bloodmoonWarningDaysleft = command /day7 issued at 1 to 6 days before bloodmoon message 
    Day7_day = text for day when only 1 day is left until bloodmoon
    Day7_days = text for days when more than 1 day is left until bloodmoon
    consolecommand setstring: new editable string framework for CPM string management. For now only /day7 uses it. Strings file will be /saves/CpmStrings.xml. Can be applied by xml edit or using the setstring command with key↔value parameters. Use setstring without parameters to list all strings. In future versions all CPM strings will be put in this framework.


**Version 5.38 (2018.11.06)**

* Added: Console command bun (blockutf8names): prevent players with non-ascii chars from logging in on your server.


**Version 5.37 (2018.11.01)**

* Added (Full verson only)

    * Complete rewrite of the fallingblock detection/prevention system: new commandname: pfb (preventfallingblocks) If enabled (<logBlockCount> value greater than 0) it will prevent any blocks from falling on your server (they will vanish). With <logBlockCount> you specify from which number of simultaneously falling blocks you would like to get informed with a logline showing number of blocks falling at once and location). 


**Version 5.36 (2018.10.29)**

- Added (Full verson only)

    * Finetuned the fallingblock detection system: When a collapse starts (20 blocks monitoring still advised) it will report first batch with tekst: 
[CSMM_Patrons] XXX falling blocks at once detected! Position: x, y, z Use substring of this for discord notification on falling blocks. All subsequent drops of the same batch will be reported as:
[CSMM_Patrons] XXX blocks are still falling on position: .x, y, z} This will indicate the durartion and severity of the collapse in log. (This can be a lot of loglines, dont put discord notification on it)
Added 0 to allowed values of sps console command: set playerkills and zombiekills to 0 is now possible again.

**Version 5.35 (2018.10.26)**

- Added (Full verson only)

    * new consolecommand sdc (setdeathcount): set the death count to any value on any player. Want to compensate that poor player with a death caused by  gamebug? Just deduct 1 of his/her death count. Want to give donors the opportunity to reset their deathcount to zero? Just create a custom donor shielded CSMM command for it (sdc ${steamId} 0) and you are good to go.
    * new fallingblock detection system: with console command mfb to set the max number of falling blocks (at once) that are allowed until the drop will be reported to log. It is disabled by default (value 0). For detecting relevant drops the adviced number is 20 as drops always break down in batches. When you get mulitiple of 20 blocks, trust me, a large portion of the map is collapsing. (wink)
    This system can be turned on ondemand. When suspecting dropmining or POI collapsing just set the value higher than 0 (advised 20) and the monitoring is in effect. The location is in the loginfo. After that you could disable the sys again with setting it to 0.
    * Added cpm- prefix to primairy console command aliases. Now all CPM commands will be grouped together when doing the help command..
    * new console command cpm-help: displays all CPM console commands.


**Version 5.34 (2018.10.21)**

- Added (Full verson only)

    * Extended reset region system with functionality to reset all(!) regions of the map that do not have claimblocks on them. 
    * New console command for resetting regions without claimblocks immedeately: resetunclaimedregionsnow This will kick all players and shutdown/reset immedeately.
    * Added parameter to shutdownba: "shutdownba <minutes> resetunclaimed": This will trigger a bloodmoon aware shutdown with a nice timer in <minutes> in chat every minute.


**Version 5.33 (2018.10.16)**

- Changed (Full verson only)

    * Changed /grablcb chatcommand to grablcb consolecommand. For chatcommand (with permissions, costs etc) use this consolecommand for creating a custom CSMM chatcommand


**Version 5.32 (2018.10.14)**

- Added (Full verson only)

    * rlp2: added option to remove all expired claimblocks from the map. Chunks will autoload if needed. ("rlp2 cleanup")
    * new consolecommand scn (serverchatname): set the global chatname of all CPM communication. With colorcode support.
    * new consolecommand getbike: tp bikes to their owners as admin or create a custom CSMM command for players to do it themselves.
    * chatcommand /grablcb: let a player pickup owned landclaims near his position (into backpack)
    * giveplus console command:
    put items directly in backpack
    added an option to give item(s) to all onine players at once (into backpack)
    when giving an item that has quality wihout defining the quality in cmd, giveplus will choose random quality
    * fixed giveplus not being able to give items without quality.

**Version 5.31 (2018.09.03)**

- Added (Full verson only)

    * console command say2: use to broadcast server messages with a custom name. Colorcoding supported.

Example: say2 "[00FF00]Whos your daddy?![-]" "No stealing, raiding, griefing allowed!"


**Version 5.30 (2018.09.02)**

- Added (Full verson only)

    * realtime PVP punishment in explicitly tagged PVE zones. PVP punishment activates when there is a notify claim with "pve" in the name AND a 3rd notify parameter is issued. The 3rd parameter can be used to fire (multiple) console command(s) at an offending player (spawn zeds, kick, ban, jail, kill, tp etc etc) for punishment. Check Advanced Claims (type Command) for syntax on commands. The mod will know a player killed a player even before the game itself does ^^. Enter,- and exitmessages are required within a PVE notify claim that has punishment. A logmessage will be written on punishment including victim and offender and their positions. This could be used to create a CSMM discord notification on PVP punishment.

    Example: ccc add PVEzone -10000 10000 10000 0 0 "notify:You are entering a PVE zone!:You are leaving a PVE zone!:kick ${entityId} 'You have been violating PVE rules.'"

**Version 5.29 (2018.08.28)**

- Added (Full verson only)

    * batch adding regions marked for reset with mrr command: mrr add <w_boundary> <e_boundary> <n_boundary> <s_boundary> and mrr remove <w_boundary> <e_boundary> <n_boundary> <s_boundary> → all regions that get touched by the defined area are added/removed to/from the reset region list.
    * console command mv: console equivalent of the /mv chatcommand. Partial playername and offline player supported 
    * console command mvw: console equivalent of the /mvw chatcommand. Partial playername and offline player supported     


**Version 5.28 (2018.08.27)**

- Fixed (Full version only):

    * XSS vulnerability in advanced claims on alloc's webmap (BIG thanks to Catalysm for reporting!)
- Added (Full verson only)

    * Customisable chatcommand prefix: use consolecommand cpmprefix to set it.
    * Chatcommand /rt : return to your origin position after using /ft or /ftw for easy teleporting      


**Version 5.27 (Light version 2.13) (2018.08.22)**

- Fixed: shutdownba settings not being persistent


**Version 5.26 (2018.08.20)**

- Added (Full version only):

    * Added offline player support for admin chatcommands /ft, /mv and /mvw

        /ft offline player

        /mv online player to offline player

        /mv offline player to online player

        /mv offline player to offline player

        /mv offline player to coordinates

        /mvw move offline player to waypoint

    * **Warning**: persistent data structure has changed and demands a wipe. While server off after updating mod, please remove /saves/Random Gen/<mapname>/CSMM_Patrons.bin before starting server again. Advise: if you have advanced claims (reset region claims will be created automatically) do a "ccc list" before updating and copy paste the output. Makes it easier to recreate after .bin wipe.



**Version 5.25 (2018.08.15)**

- Added (Full version only):

    * Added permadeath play: tag players as permadeath player and they will be resetted when they die. Use console command pd (permadeath) for managing the permadeath players
    * Added interfaces to allocs webmap for all advanced claims: display all adv. claims on allocs webmap. Shielded behind permission webapi.viewallclaims in webpermissions.xml.
    Download the patch needed for Allocs webmap here.

    * Added a special substance to reset regions which will melt any landclaimblock that is put on them.
    * Added ghost claim removal (landclaims that have been reset but are still present on Alloc's webmap). Will automatically do its work on regions marked for reset.


**Version 5.24 (2018.08.11)**

- Added (Full version only):

    * Added new adv. claim type "playerlevel": this claim can be used to restrict/grant access to a claim by playerlevel. Built in basic logical expression support and level ranges. 
    Supported operators: <= (and =<), >= (and =>), == (and =), != (and =!) Define ranges by using 2 operators in 1 claim (use & between expressions).
    Examples:
    allow levels between 5 and 10: playerlevel:>=5&<=10
    allow only level 5: playerlevel:=5
    allow all levels but 5: playerlevel:!=5

* Added (Full version only)

    * console command ccc (claimcontrolcommand): added methods to make creating claims easier. Implemented p1 p2 functionality like you may allready know from pblock commands. And radius functionality. Radius will create a claim of any type based on the position of a player or antity making borders at distance <radius> from the player/entity. This could be used for creating a CSMM custom command to let players make a defensive claim themselves. Make that a timed claim even and players could be charged an amount of currency to set it for another week for example.
