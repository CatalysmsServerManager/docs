# Contributing

For small changes (like fixing a typo), you can use the links at the bottom of a page to use the Github web editor.

## Local development

```
git clone https://github.com/CatalysmsServerManager/docs
yarn # or npm install
```

You should install the necessary dev dependencies afterwards, so that you can view the site locally. You can start the development server with `npm run dev` 

## Tips, warnings, and danger messages

If you have a tip to share with to user, you can format them in a specific way so that it looks appealing and noticable. The same goes for warning and "danger" messages.

```
::: tip

:::

::: warning
Make sure you're on version 2.0.0 or above before trying this.
:::

::: danger
Be careful; this action is irreversible!
