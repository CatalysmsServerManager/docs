## Web editor

For small changes (like fixing a typo), you can use the links at the bottom of a page to use the Github web editor.

## Local development

Install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/). VuePress requires Node.js >= 8

```
git clone https://github.com/CatalysmsServerManager/docs
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Submitting changes

To submit changes, please create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests).

### Step by step guide

First we start off by finding the page you want to make a change to. At the bottom of the page, you will find a edit link.

![Missing image](/assets/images/contributing/pull-request-1.png)

This will open up a link to Github where you can create a fork of the repository. This is essentially a copy of the repository on your own Github profile.

After creating the fork, you will see a web editor where you can make the change(s) you want. After making the change(s), scroll down and save your work.

Upon saving your changes, you will see an overview. Your work is now saved in your personal fork. To send your changes to the actual repository, you must now create a pull request (PR).

Give your PR a useful title and optionally a description.

Finally, you will see the PR. Some automated checks will happen, checking if the config still works and checking if the build process succeeds. You will also get a deploy preview so you can see what your change(s) will look like on the real website.

At this point, a maintainer can accept your change(s). This will merge your forked repo with the main one and your changes will go live!

## Adding a new page

- Create a new file in the appropriate location

  For example, `docs/en/CSMM/new-page.md`

- Add the new page to the sidebar

  Modify the appropriate file in `docs/.vuepress/sidebars/`

## Tips, warnings, and danger messages

If you have a tip to share with to user, you can format them in a specific way so that it looks appealing and noticable. The same goes for warning and "danger" messages.

```
