# Chat Commands

Currently 3rdshift only has one chat command, details below. All chat commands use the - prefix to prevent conflicts with other modsIf you are running CPM and have hccp enabled you will need to change the cpm folder name to start with a 4. 3rdshift will not interferewith other mods chat commands as only mine are detected and rest are passed onto the game for others to handle.
