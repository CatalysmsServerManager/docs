    If you want to give the player a reward, then add:
    `say "The reward is coming!" ;wait(5);Se ${entityId} 103;say "A supply box was landing next to you."`

- Let players control the weather. Stop rain/snow/... . This uses a custom argument to specify the type of weather to stop.

    `debuffplayer ${entityId} buffLegBroken; debuffplayer ${entityId} buffLegSprained`

    `teleportplayer ${entityId} 713 86 1425; sayplayer  ${entityId} "Welcome to the safehouse!"`

- Let players create CPM advanced claims on their own. These provide better protection than regular land claim blocks. This includes 2 commands, one to create and one to remove.

    *   `ccc radius 40 ${entityId} ${steamId} 1`
    *   `ccc remove ${steamId}`

- Heal command

    `buffplayer ${entityId} firstAid; debuffplayer ${entityId} bleeding; sayplayer ${entityId} "Healed!!"`
    
    For healiing players, Prisma has created a [Healme modlet](/assets/modlets/HealmeBuff.zip)
    You could add new custom commands, one for players like $healme
    one for admins like $heal PLAYERNAME
    
    "healme" is the buff you need to call in your custom command. It will give a player godmode for a given time (in seconds) using the wait() command.
    
    Example:
    
`buffplayer ${player.entityId} healme; wait(6);debuffplayer ${player.entityId} healme;debuffplayer  ${player.entityId} buffLegSprained;debuffplayer ${player.entityId} buffLegBroken; say "Regeneration completed!"`
    
 Here a Player will be healed over 6 seconds, broken legs will be repaired.
 You can use "healme" also for just an admin command like $heal PLAYERNAME, where PLAYERNAME is stored in an argument.
 
- Let a player take his LCB

    `cpm-grablcb ${entityId} 10;sayplayer ${steamId} "Your LCB is in your bag."`
