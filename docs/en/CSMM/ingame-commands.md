# Ingame commands

## Enabling ingame commands

To enable ingame commands, visit your servers settings page and scroll down to the ingame commands section. Enable the module with the button and set the prefix you want.

:::tip
For best results, choose a prefix that is not shared with other mods or server managers.

In the rest of this article, we will assume your prefix is \$.

## Commands reference

The easiest way to get more info on a command is to use the `$help` ingame command. This will give you a list of all available commands, if you want more info on a particular command you can use `$help settele`.
