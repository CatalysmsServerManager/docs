# PrismaCore Settings

## Intro

PrismaCore has a lot of flexibility when it comes to how it behaves and what features are active. Settings can be done by consolecommands and are set in /Saves/PrismaCoreSettings.xml eventually. PrismaCoreSettings.xml can be editted manually too and saving it will make the changed settings effective immediately even on a running server.

## The various settings explained

`<AdvClaims_Reversed_TpHeight>-1</AdvClaims_Reversed_TpHeight>`

By default the revesed claim teleport sends the player to ground level (y=-1). Set this to a height if you want the player to tp to a specific height.

`<AdvClaims_PVP_KillingMode>3</AdvClaims_PVP_KillingMode>`

Define the PVP killing mode in an Adv. Claim PVP

`<BlockUTF8Names_Enabled>true</BlockUTF8Names_Enabled>`

Prevent or allow players to connect that have UTF-8 charset characters in their name.

`<BloodmoonSpawner_DespawnAllOnStart>false</BloodmoonSpawner_DespawnAllOnStart>`

Despawn all zombies alive on map right before bloodmoon starts. This will make sure you get as much bloodmoonspawns as possible.

`<BloodmoonSpawner_OverrideVanillaSpawner>false</BloodmoonSpawner_OverrideVanillaSpawner>`

Set true to override vanilla bloodmoon spawner and let PrismaCore handle bloodmoon.

`<BloodmoonSpawner_Overridden_AdjustBMEnemyCountPerPlayerToNrOnlinePlayers>true</BloodmoonSpawner_Overridden_AdjustBMEnemyCountPerPlayerToNrOnlinePlayers>`

Set true to let PrismaCore handle the bloodmoonspawning based on number of online players. This is the full auto mode and is recommended. Max alive zombies per player will be calculated and when players are in a bloodmoon party, PrismaCore will bring the joy to all members of that party.

`<BloodmoonSpawner_Overridden_BMEnemyCountPerPlayer>2</BloodmoonSpawner_Overridden_BMEnemyCountPerPlayer>`

Only used if the previous setting is false. This will set the maximum number of zombies alive per player during bloodmoon regardless of number of players online.

`<BloodmoonSpawner_Overridden_AddMaxAliveServerDuringBloodmoon>0</BloodmoonSpawner_Overridden_AddMaxAliveServerDuringBloodmoon>`

This value will be added to the maximum allowed zombies alive that is configured in serverconfig.xml. Use this to spice up the bloodmoon spawning even more by allowing more zombies alive during bloodmoons.
