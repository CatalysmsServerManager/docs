Catalysm's Server Manager & Monitor (CSMM) is a management and monitoring portal for 7 Days To Die servers. From here, you can look at server performance, track player actions and movement, give items, ban problematic players, manage a server economy, and more. Once connected to your server, CSMM gives you an unparalleled amount of visibility and control over your environment, allowing you to take actions that would otherwise require console access. From this one web interface, you can manage multiple separate servers, each with their own unique permissions, settings, and configurations.
